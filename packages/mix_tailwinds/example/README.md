# mix_tailwinds parity playground

This example renders the same UI twice: once with `mix_tailwinds` (Flutter) and once with real Tailwind CSS (HTML). Use it to verify that our class parser stays aligned with upstream Tailwind semantics.

## Requirements

- Dart SDK `>=3.11.0`
- Flutter `>=3.41.0`

## Directory layout

- `lib/main.dart` – Flutter app that drives the Mix `Div`/`Span` widgets. A width slider lets you exercise the responsive tokens (e.g., `md:flex-row`).
- `real_tailwind/index.html` – Standalone CDN-powered Tailwind page that reuses the exact same class strings.
- `real_tailwind/flowbite-card.html` – Flowbite-style card fixture using semantic Tailwind aliases plus a matching `FlowbiteCardPreview` Flutter implementation.
- `real_tailwind/complex-parity.html` – Pinned Tailwind 4.3.1 reference for ten isolated complex utility, responsive, and interaction cases; paired with `ComplexParityPreview`.

## Run the Flutter preview

```bash
cd packages/mix_tailwinds/example
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos   # or chrome/ios/android as needed
```

The slider across the top constrains the preview width between 320 px and 1040 px so you can quickly check behavior below and above the Tailwind `md` breakpoint (768 px).

## Run the real Tailwind sample

Open the HTML file directly in a browser (or serve it via any static server):

```bash
cd packages/mix_tailwinds/example
open real_tailwind/index.html
# — or —
python3 -m http.server 5173 --directory real_tailwind
```

Because the document pulls Tailwind from the official CDN, no extra tooling is required. Resize the browser window to the same widths you used in the Flutter app; every class list is identical between both experiences.

## Visual comparison tool

A Playwright-based tool captures screenshots of both the Flutter and Tailwind versions at canonical widths (480, 768, 1024 px), then diffs them with `pixelmatch`.

1. Start the Flutter web server:

   ```bash
   cd packages/mix_tailwinds/example
   # If you see "not configured to build on the web", run:
   #   flutter create . --platforms=web
   flutter run -d web-server --web-port=8089 --profile
   ```

2. Run the comparison:

   ```bash
   cd packages/mix_tailwinds/tool/visual-comparison
   npm install   # first time only
   npm run compare
   npm run compare -- --example=flowbite-card
   npm run compare:complex # all ten cases at 480/768/1024
   ```

Screenshots and diff images are saved to `packages/mix_tailwinds/visual-comparison/`.

## Generate Flutter goldens

Render the Flutter surface into golden PNGs (same widths):

```bash
cd packages/mix_tailwinds/example
flutter test --update-goldens test/parity_golden_test.dart
```

The outputs live under `packages/mix_tailwinds/example/test/goldens/`.

## Notes

- The example starts from `TwConfig.standard()`. Screenshot mode pins both the Flutter and Tailwind reference screenshots to the bundled `TwParityRoboto` font so pixel comparisons do not depend on platform system-font metrics.
- `flowbite-card` extends `TwConfig.standard()` locally for Flowbite semantic aliases such as `bg-neutral-primary-soft`, `rounded-base`, and `text-heading`.
- `assets/images/flowbite-card-hero.svg` is retained as the editable source artwork; the Flutter and browser fixtures both render its rasterized PNG counterpart.
- `flowbite-card` maps Flowbite inline SVGs to `TwIcon` with Material icon equivalents. This keeps the Flutter side in the `mix_tailwinds` widget model while avoiding a separate SVG/path renderer.
- The components intentionally stick to utilities we already support (layout, spacing, border, radius, typography, responsive prefixes, and hover states on the buttons). If you add more classes to a Flutter example, mirror the change in its matching `real_tailwind/*.html` fixture so comparisons stay 1:1.
