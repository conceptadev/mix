/// Naked widgets for Flutter.
///
/// This library provides a collection of non-styled, customizable widgets
/// that handle state and interaction logic without imposing visual styling.
///
/// Naked components use a callback-driven approach where:
/// 1. Components provide callbacks for state changes (hover, focus, press)
/// 2. Consumers manage their own state using these callbacks
/// 3. Consumers have full control over visual styling
