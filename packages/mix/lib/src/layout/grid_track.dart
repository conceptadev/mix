/// How a grid track is sized.
///
/// Rows accept fixed, fractional, and content-sized [GridTrack.auto] tracks.
/// Columns accept only fixed and fractional tracks; content-sized columns
/// are intentionally outside this API.
///
/// One type covers both axes, so "auto is rows-only" is a runtime rule
/// (see `_validateTracks` in `grid_box_spec.dart`) rather than a compile-time
/// one. Splitting this into row and column hierarchies was considered and
/// rejected: it would not remove the equivalent check in the wire codec —
/// JSON is untyped, so the schema must reject `auto` under `columns`
/// regardless of the Dart type — and the factories below have static type
/// `GridTrack`, so axis-specific lists would force duplicate factories or
/// give up the dot-shorthand (`.columns([.fr(1)])`) this API is built around.
/// The trade is one runtime throw against those two costs; do not "simplify"
/// this into a split without re-checking both.
