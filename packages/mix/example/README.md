# Mix examples

These apps consume only Mix's public `package:mix/mix.dart` library.

Run the WrapBox gallery from this directory:

```sh
flutter run
```

Run the GridBox gallery with dashboard, card-catalog, media-gallery, and
implicit-animation use cases:

```sh
flutter run -t lib/grid_main.dart
```

## GridBox

The Grid gallery switches between compact, medium, and wide parent widths. Its
styles use `onConstraints`, so each Grid responds to its own offered space
rather than the viewport:

```dart
final GridBoxStyler cardGrid = .equalColumns(3)
    .gap(16)
    .autoRows(.fixed(220))
    .onConstraints(
  .maxWidth(760),
  .equalColumns(2).gap(12),
).onConstraints(
  .maxWidth(520),
  .equalColumns(1).gap(10),
);

GridBox(style: cardGrid, children: cards);
```

The dashboard composes two independent GridBoxes: metrics transition from four
to two to one column, while the asymmetric report panels transition from two
columns to one.

  <img src="test/goldens/grid_dashboard_compact.png" alt="Compact GridBox dashboard" width="24%">
</p>

The same track model handles repeated product cards and a denser media gallery:

  <img src="test/goldens/grid_gallery_compact.png" alt="Compact GridBox media gallery" width="24%">
</p>

### Grid animation

The Animation example toggles a two-column planning Grid between balanced and
focused geometry. Rebuilding the same two fractional tracks lets Mix
interpolate their weights from 1:1 to 2:1 while also animating the repeated row
height and gaps. The gallery deliberately uses 1.2 seconds so the interpolation
is easy to inspect; product transitions can be shorter:

![GridBox interpolating between balanced and focused tracks](../screenshots/grid_animation_demo.gif)

```dart
final GridBoxStyler animatedGrid = .columns([
  .fr(focused ? 2 : 1),
  .fr(1),
])
    .autoRows(.fixed(focused ? 148 : 112))
    .gap(focused ? 20 : 12)
    .animate(.easeInOut(const Duration(milliseconds: 1200)));
```

No `AnimationController` is needed. Track lists with different lengths or
kinds switch at the midpoint instead, and `onConstraints` branch selection
remains immediate because it happens during layout.

</p>

## WrapBox

The primary example uses WrapBoxStyler's flattened fluent methods:

```dart
final style = WrapBoxStyler()
    .paddingAll(16)
    .spacing(8)
    .runSpacing(10)
    .wrapAlignment(WrapAlignment.center);
```

For advanced composition, `.flow(WrapStyler(...))` replaces or merges the
nested Wrap style directly. The name is `flow` because `.wrap()` is the Mix
widget-modifier API. On WrapBoxStyler, `.alignment()` and `.clipBehavior()`
belong to the outer Box; `.wrapAlignment()` and `.wrapClipBehavior()` belong
to Flutter's inner Wrap.

The widget tests include smoke coverage and deterministic responsive golden
images for both galleries:

```sh
flutter test
```
