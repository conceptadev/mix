# mix_protocol

`mix_protocol` is the versioned JSON wire protocol for representable Mix
styles and token themes. It decodes untrusted JSON into real Mix stylers,
encodes supported runtime stylers into canonical JSON, and exports JSON Schema
for authoring tools.

The package is intentionally narrow:

- one fixed core v1 vocabulary for `box`, `text`, `flex`, `wrap`, `stack`,
  `icon`, `image`, `flex_box`, `wrap_box`, `stack_box`, and `grid_box` styles;
- one shared core-only `mixProtocol` façade, plus explicit immutable vocabulary
  composition for packages that define their own stylers;
- strict decode by default, with bounded lenient recovery for additive data;
- stable path-qualified diagnostics and fail-loud encoding;
- per-call icon and image identity resolution; and
- no runtime registry, import side effects, public Ack types, widget-tree
  model, transport, or persistence policy.

Ack 1.2.0 supplies the private codecs and JSON Schema export. Mix generated
stylers remain the runtime model. Protocol code does not generate a second
style model.

`SchemaField` in [schema_field.dart](lib/src/schema/schema_field.dart) owns each
wire field, value codec, and lenient repair metadata. The property and token
factories in [common_codecs.dart](lib/src/schema/common_codecs.dart) supply the
wire grammar. The exporter uses these declarations directly. Composite codecs
prepare each nested styler once per encoding operation.

The public API keeps Ack private. Protocol v1 includes the additive
`context_focus_visible` selector.

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:mix/mix.dart';
import 'package:mix_protocol/mix_protocol.dart';

final result = mixProtocol.decodeStyle<BoxStyler>({
  'v': 1,
  'type': 'box',
  'padding': 16,
  'decoration': {'color': '#3D5AFE'},
});

final style = switch (result) {
  MixProtocolSuccess<BoxStyler>(:final value) => value,
  MixProtocolFailure<BoxStyler>(:final errors) =>
    throw FormatException('$errors'),
};

final encoded = mixProtocol.encodeStyle(style);
final styleSchema = mixProtocol.exportStyleJsonSchema();
```

Theme documents use the same façade:

```dart
final theme = switch (mixProtocol.decodeTheme(themeJson)) {
  MixProtocolSuccess<MixProtocolTheme>(:final value) => value,
  MixProtocolFailure<MixProtocolTheme>(:final errors) =>
    throw FormatException('$errors'),
};

final scope = MixScope(tokens: theme.tokens, child: app);
final themeSchema = mixProtocol.exportThemeJsonSchema();
```

Every top-level document must carry `v: 1`; nested variant styles inherit the
root version. Explicit JSON `null` is forbidden. Unsupported runtime values
fail encode instead of being silently omitted.

Packages can contribute namespaced, independently versioned style words without
changing the core singleton. Composition is explicit and deterministic:

```dart
final chartProtocol = MixProtocol.compose([
  mixProtocolCoreVocabulary,
  mixChartVocabulary,
]);
```

Integration packages may also expose that deterministic composition as a
ready-to-use value; `mix_chart_protocol` provides `mixChartProtocol` for the
common core-plus-chart case.

Contributed discriminators include their vocabulary wire major, such as
`mix_chart.v1.line_chart`. See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) for authoring and consuming
vocabularies.

## Protocol, schema, and future documents

These are distinct layers:

- **Protocol:** the accepted payloads, canonical output, versioning, recovery,
  identity, token, and diagnostic semantics implemented here.
- **JSON Schema:** a generated description of the style or theme input shape
  for editors and CI. It is an artifact of the protocol, not a parallel source
  of truth.
- **Document layer:** a future widget-tree or server-driven UI format may embed
  these per-node style payloads. Widget trees, events, and component identity
  are not part of `mix_protocol` v1.

### Checked-in schema and fixtures

`schema/` holds the exported `style.schema.json` and `theme.schema.json`
together with `fixtures/*.json`, the documents that pin each schema's
acceptance boundary. `manifest.json` lists the suites. The files are generated
by `test/schema_fixtures_test.dart` and checked for staleness on every test
run; regenerate them with:

```bash
melos run schema:fixtures
```

Schema changes therefore appear as reviewable diffs. `tool/schema-check`
validates every checked-in suite in the repository with
[Ajv](https://ajv.js.org) under strict Draft 7 settings, so the exported schema
is proven by an implementation that shares nothing with Ack:

```bash
melos run schema:check
```

Packages that compose their own vocabulary reuse the same pipeline through
`package:mix_protocol/testing.dart`: build a `SchemaFixtureSuite` and call
`syncSchemaFixtures` from a golden test, and the Ajv job picks up the new
`schema/manifest.json` automatically.

`mix_winds` remains a direct Mix styler producer at runtime. Its test suite
uses `mix_protocol` as a development-only reference consumer to prove that a
supported utility ledger retains its resolved styles through Protocol encoding.
Its `schema/fixtures/style.json` carries one encoded document per supported
ledger family for the Ajv check. Runtime plans and target diagnostics remain
separate checks.

See [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) for integration patterns and
[WIRE_CONTRACT.md](WIRE_CONTRACT.md) for the complete v1 grammar.
