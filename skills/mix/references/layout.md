# Layout with Mix

Choose and compose Mix-owned layout primitives without falling back to raw
Flutter layout widgets for styling concerns.

## Verify API Availability

Check the consuming package's `pubspec.yaml` and resolved dependency before
using a layout API. This repository's `main` branch includes `WrapBox` and
`GridBox`, both first shipped in the `mix 2.2.0-beta.2` release. When working in
the Mix repository, prefer local source. When working downstream, confirm the
installed version exposes the referenced classes.

## Select the Primitive

| Layout need | Mix primitive | Why |
|---|---|---|
| One child with size, padding, constraints, or decoration | `Box` + `BoxStyler` | Owns single-child box styling |
| One non-wrapping horizontal or vertical sequence | `RowBox`, `ColumnBox`, or `FlexBox` + `FlexBoxStyler` | Combines Flex geometry with outer Box styling |
| Intrinsic items that should flow onto additional runs | `WrapBox` + `WrapBoxStyler` | Models tags, chips, and button groups without fixed tracks |
| Explicit two-dimensional rows and columns | `GridBox` + `GridBoxStyler` | Models dashboards, card catalogs, and galleries with fixed/`fr` tracks |
| Overlapping or positioned children | `StackBox` + `StackBoxStyler` | Combines Stack geometry with outer Box styling |

Prefer the simplest primitive that represents the layout semantics. Do not use
Grid merely to place a single row, and do not use Wrap when columns must align
across runs.

## Understand Composite Layouts

`FlexBox`, `WrapBox`, and `StackBox` resolve a layout sub-spec and optionally an
outer `BoxSpec`. Their Stylers therefore expose both layout and Box methods.
Keep decoration, padding, margin, transforms, and constraints on the composite
Styler instead of nesting a raw `Container`.

`GridBox` is different: it owns Grid geometry, clipping, Mix variants,
modifiers, and animation, but it does not contain an outer `BoxSpec`. Wrap it
in `Box` when the grid itself needs padding or decoration:

```dart
Box(
  style: BoxStyler().paddingAll(16).color(Colors.white),
  child: GridBox(style: gridStyle, children: cards),
);
```

Use the layout-only `FlexStyler`, `WrapStyler`, and `StackStyler` when composing
the nested sub-style directly. For ordinary widget code, start from the
corresponding `*BoxStyler`.

## Build One-Dimensional Layouts

Use `RowBox` or `ColumnBox` when direction is fixed by the widget:

```dart
final toolbarStyle = FlexBoxStyler()
    .mainAxisAlignment(.spaceBetween)
    .crossAxisAlignment(.center)
    .spacing(12)
    .paddingAll(16);

RowBox(style: toolbarStyle, children: actions);
```

Do not set a conflicting direction on a `RowBox` or `ColumnBox` style. Use
`FlexBox` when direction itself is dynamic:

```dart
final contentStyle = FlexBoxStyler()
    .direction(isCompact ? .vertical : .horizontal)
    .spacing(16);

FlexBox(style: contentStyle, children: sections);
```

Use `.wrap(WidgetModifierConfig.flexible(...))` on a child Styler when that
child needs Flutter `Flexible` behavior inside a Flex layout. Keep parent
alignment and spacing on `FlexBoxStyler`.

## Build Wrapping Layouts

Use `WrapBox` for items whose intrinsic widths determine where runs break:

```dart
final tagCloudStyle = WrapBoxStyler()
    .paddingAll(16)
    .spacing(8)
    .runSpacing(10)
    .wrapAlignment(.center);

WrapBox(style: tagCloudStyle, children: tags);
```

Distinguish the collision-safe composite names:

- `.alignment(...)` and `.clipBehavior(...)` configure the outer Box.
- `.wrapAlignment(...)` and `.wrapClipBehavior(...)` configure the inner Wrap.
- `.flow(WrapStyler(...))` replaces or merges the nested Wrap style directly.
- `.wrap(...)` remains Mix's widget-modifier API, so the nested Wrap field is
  intentionally named `flow`.

Choose Wrap over Grid for tags, filters, and button groups that have varying
intrinsic widths. Choose Grid when cells need shared column boundaries or
explicit row heights.

## Build Two-Dimensional Grid Layouts

### Start with explicit tracks

Give a Grid declaration an explicit `GridBoxStyler` type, then use factory
shorthand to make its topology visible:

```dart
final GridBoxStyler cardGridStyle = .equalColumns(3)
    .gap(16)
    .autoRows(.fixed(220));

GridBox(style: cardGridStyle, children: cards);
```

Use `.equalColumns(count)` for equal `fr(1)` columns. Use `.columns([...])` for
mixed geometry:

```dart
final GridBoxStyler reportGridStyle = .columns([
  .fixed(240),
  .fr(2),
  .fr(1),
]).columnGap(16).autoRows(.fixed(280));
```

Interpret tracks as follows:

- `.fixed(240)` consumes 240 logical pixels and does not shrink.
- `.fr(2)` receives twice the remaining space of `.fr(1)` after fixed tracks
  and gaps.
- Fractional columns require bounded width.
- Fractional rows and fractional `autoRows` require bounded height.

### Provide row geometry

Children fill columns left to right, then advance row by row. Provide enough
explicit `.rows([...])` tracks for every required row or set `.autoRows(...)`
for the remaining rows. A non-empty Grid with no applicable row track reports
an error instead of guessing content-sized geometry.

```dart
final GridBoxStyler galleryStyle = .equalColumns(2)
    .rows([.fixed(180)])
    .autoRows(.fixed(180))
    .columnGap(12)
    .rowGap(12);
```

With five children and two columns, this Grid needs three rows. The first uses
the explicit track and the next two repeat `autoRows`. In a vertical
`SingleChildScrollView`, use fixed row tracks because height is unbounded.

### Respond to the offered container

Use `.onConstraints(...)` when a Grid should adapt to the maximum size offered
by its own parent:

```dart
final GridBoxStyler responsiveCards = .equalColumns(3)
    .gap(16)
    .autoRows(.fixed(220))
    .onConstraints(
      .maxWidth(760),
      .equalColumns(2).gap(12),
    )
    .onConstraints(
      .maxWidth(520),
      .equalColumns(1).gap(10),
    );
```

Apply matching branches in declaration order. In the example, both maximum
width branches match below 520, so the later one-column patch refines the
earlier two-column patch.

Keep `onConstraints` patches geometry-only. They may set columns, rows,
`autoRows`, `columnGap`, and `rowGap`. They may not set clipping, modifiers,
animations, ordinary variants, or nested constraint branches. Put those values
on the base `GridBoxStyler`.

Use `.onBreakpoint(...)` instead when the decision should observe viewport
size through `MediaQuery`. Two Grids in the same viewport can select different
`onConstraints` branches because their parents offer different widths.

### Pick Grid for concrete use cases

Use responsive `GridBox` for:

- metric dashboards whose panels collapse from four to two to one column;
- product catalogs with equal card widths and repeated fixed row heights;
- media galleries with aligned tracks and controlled clipping;
- asymmetric report layouts using fixed sidebar tracks plus fractional content;
- nested components that should respond to their container rather than the
  whole device viewport.

Avoid the current Grid API when the design requires content-sized tracks,
spans, named areas, masonry packing, direction-aware placement, or baseline
alignment. Those features are intentionally outside the current contract. Use
a more suitable Flutter layout or redesign the track model rather than
pretending the API supports them.

### Animate compatible geometry

Use the standard Mix `.animate(...)` API when state changes Grid geometry:

```dart
final GridBoxStyler animatedGrid = .columns([
  .fr(focused ? 2 : 1),
  .fr(1),
])
    .autoRows(.fixed(focused ? 148 : 112))
    .gap(focused ? 20 : 12)
    .animate(.easeInOut(const Duration(milliseconds: 400)));
```

Keep track lists the same length and keep each positional track kind compatible
(`fixed` with `fixed`, `fr` with `fr`) for continuous interpolation. Compatible
rows, `autoRows`, and gaps interpolate too. Track-count or track-kind changes,
clipping, and constraint-patch lists switch at the midpoint. A live
`onConstraints` branch change remains immediate because selection happens
during layout rather than creating a new animation target.

### Handle overflow deliberately

Expect fixed tracks to preserve their requested size even when they exceed the
available extent. Leave `clipBehavior` at `.none` when overflow should remain
visible with diagnostics, or set it on the base style when painting must be
contained:

```dart
final GridBoxStyler clippedGallery = .equalColumns(4)
    .autoRows(.fixed(160))
    .gap(12)
    .clipBehavior(.hardEdge);
```

## Build Overlays

Use `StackBox` for badges, overlays, and positioned content:

```dart
final overlayStyle = StackBoxStyler()
    .paddingAll(12)
    .borderRounded(16)
    .stackAlignment(.bottomCenter)
    .stackClipBehavior(.none);

StackBox(style: overlayStyle, children: layers);
```

Distinguish `.alignment(...)` and `.clipBehavior(...)` for the outer Box from
`.stackAlignment(...)` and `.stackClipBehavior(...)` for the inner Stack. Use
`.stack(StackStyler(...))` for direct nested-style composition.

## Verify Layout Work

Check the smallest source and test surface that owns the behavior:

- Grid guide: `packages/mix/doc/grid-layout.md`
- Grid runnable use cases: `packages/mix/example/lib/grid_example.dart`
- Grid contract tests: `packages/mix/test/src/layout/`
- Wrap runnable use case: `packages/mix/example/lib/main.dart`
- Flex, Wrap, and Stack composites: `packages/mix/lib/src/specs/`

Run focused widget tests while iterating. Before handing off changes to Mix
layout internals, run the repository-required generation, test, and analysis
commands from the main skill.
