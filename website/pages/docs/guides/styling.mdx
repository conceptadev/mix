# Styling with Mix

Mix enhances Flutter development with a functional styling approach, focusing on separating visual semantics from business logic for improved readability and maintainability. Its emphasis on concise style declarations simplifies the workflow, allowing the creation of complex styles from simple building blocks.

This method fosters modularity, reusability, and flexibility in styling, streamlining the process of defining and applying styles to widgets.

## Key Concepts

- **Functionality**: The `Style` class is engineered for efficient handling and reuse of styling attributes and variants. Its design simplifies the application of uniform and reusable styles throughout your Flutter application.
- **Mechanism**: It integrates various styling aspects, including colors, fonts, dimensions, and more, into a unified construct, streamlining the application of styles to widgets.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Beyond conventional styling attributes, `Style` also supports dynamic variants, enabling context-responsive and adaptable styling solutions.

### **Crafting Your Unique Style**

Creating a Mix style is a seamless process. Start by constructing a `Style` object and incorporate your desired attributes:

```dart
final style = Style(
  height(100),
  width(100),
  backgroundColor.purple(),
  borderRadius(10),
);
```

  Important Note: Remember that the sequence of attributes is crucial in their
  composition and overriding. Styling attributes merge sequentially, with
  subsequent attributes taking precedence.

### **Composing Styles**

Create styles by combining and merging multiple Style instances. This technique, called style composition, allows you to build complex styles while ensuring modularity, reusability, flexibility, and maintainability in your codebase. The secret lies in calling the Mix class and passing attributes as arguments.

#### **Mixing Attributes**

Simply use the `mix()` method on a Style instance. For example:

```dart
final baseStyle = Style(
  height(100),
  width(100),
  backgroundColor.purple(),
  borderRadius(10),
);

final newStyle = baseStyle.mix(
  border.width(2),
  border.color.black(),
);
```

In this example, the `newStyle` inherits all attributes from the `baseStyle`, and add `border.width` and `border.color` attributes to it.

#### **Overriding Attributes**

**Taking Control** You can also override specific attributes of a style by passing new values to the `mix()` method. For instance:

```dart
final newStyle = baseStyle.mix(
  backgroundColor.blue(),
);
```

In this example, the `newStyle` will inherit all attributes from the `baseStyle`, except for the `backgroundColor` attribute, which will be overridden by the new value.

#### **Combining Styles**

You can also combine multiple styles into a single one.

```dart
final newStyle = Style.combine([
  baseStyle,
  otherStyle,
]);
```

#### Merging Styles

Use the `merge()` method on a Style instance. For example:

```dart
final otherStyle = Style(
  border.width(2),
  border.color.black(),
);

final newStyle = baseStyle.merge(otherStyle);
```

In this example, the `newStyle` will inherit all attributes from both the `baseStyle` and the `otherStyle`, with the `otherStyle` taking priority over the `baseStyle` in case of conflicts.

#### Applying Styles

To apply styles individually, use `apply()`. This gives you control over their order.

In this example, the `backgroundColor` attribute of the `baseStyle` is overridden by the `backgroundColor` attribute of the `newStyle`:

```dart
final newStyle = Style(
  apply(baseStyle),
  backgroundColor.blue(),
);
```

However, if you add `apply` after the `backgroundColor` attribute, the `backgroundColor` will be overridden by the `baseStyle`:

```dart
final newStyle = Style(
  backgroundColor.blue(),
  apply(baseStyle),
);
```

### **Benefits of Composition**

- **Modularity**: Break down complex styles into manageable chunks, which can be combined or merged as needed.
- **Reusability**: Encourage the reuse of common style elements, reducing redundancy and maintaining consistency across the UI.
- **Flexibility**: Dynamically adjust styles based on different conditions or user interactions.
- **Maintainability**: Simplify the maintenance of styles, as changes can be made to individual mixes rather than entire stylesheets.
