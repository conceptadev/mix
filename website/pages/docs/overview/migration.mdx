# Migration Guide

## 0.0.7 to 1.0.0

In our pursuit of API usability and efficiency, we introduced several deprecations in the latest Mix Package versions. If you encounter issues not covered by deprecation notices, please [open an issue or send a PR to our deprecation file](https://github.com/btwld/mix/blob/main/lib/src/deprecations.dart).

### Deprecations

The major updates are:

#### `Mix` evolved to `Style`
The `Mix` class is now `Style`. Several methods in the renamed class, including `withVariants`, `withMaybeVariants` among others, are deprecated to boost performance and reduce potential confusion.

| before 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 |
| ------- | ------ |
| `Mix`   | `Style` |
| `Mix.withVariant` | `Style.applyVariant` |
| `Mix.withManyVariants` | `Style.applyVariants` |
| `withMaybeVariant` or `withMaybeVariants` | removed |


Another important change is that the `Style` no longer contains a generic type. Therefore, in the new version, it is no longer possible.

#### `MixContextBuilder` was renamed to `SpecBuilder`
The `MixContextBuilder` was renamed to `SpecBuilder` to better reflect its purpose. The `MixContextBuilder` is now deprecated.

#### Widget Updates

`TextMix` and `IconMix` widgets are deprecated. Use `StyledText` and `StyledIcon` respectively.

#### Short Aliases

To enhance readability, short aliases and shorthand property/method names are replaced with their fully named counterparts. You can find the full list of removed aliases in the [deprecations file](https://github.com/btwld/mix/blob/main/lib/src/deprecations.dart)

#### Modifiers

The order of modifiers was previously determined by their addition sequence. Now, we enforce a specific ordering but also allow customizable orders. This might cause behavior changes in rare cases. For details, refer to the [modifiers guide](https://fluttermix.com/docs/guides/modifiers).

### StyledWidgets updates

#### The new PressableBox

To provide a more consistent way to use the gesture APIs, we developed a new widget that merges the functionalities of `Box` and `Pressable`. Thus, the new `PressableBox` can receive a style like a `Box` and also accept interactions and its variants, similar to a `Pressable`. For more information, see the [PressableBox guide](https://www.fluttermix.com/docs/widgets/pressable-box).
Keep in mind that the idea is to reserve the old `Pressable` for more advanced cases.

### Behavior changes

#### Modifiers

Modifiers cannot be inherited by any children. The reason is that the abstract class `Attribute` has gained a new property, `isInheritable`, which can be set to false if you want your custom attributes to be non-inheritable, such as Modifiers.

#### Operators `and` (`&`) and `or` (`|`)

The operators have been redesigned to allow for concatenation and grouping, enabling the creation of conditions like, `(primary | secondary) & onHover`. For details, refer to the [variants guide](https://www.fluttermix.com/docs/guides/variants#combining-operators)

#### StyledWidgets and Modifiers

A bunch of `StyledWidgets` now allow receiving modifiers' attributes, including `StyledIcon`, `StyledFlex`, and `StyledIcon`. Additionally, when a modifier is not applied to a Style, a `RenderWidgetModifiers` will not be present in the widget tree. This simplification makes the widget easier to debug.

#### Theming

The `MixTheme` feature has been improved and now offers a better API. It can be applied to main attributes using the method `.of`, as shown in the following code:

```dart
const primaryColor = ColorToken('primary');
final theme = MixThemeData(
  colors: {
    primaryColor: Colors.blue,
  },
);

// ... body method ...
MixTheme(
  data: theme,
  Box(
    key: key,
    style: Style(
      $box.color.ref(primaryColor),
    ),
  )
)
```
### The use of $
In version 1.0.0, the `$` symbol is now used to access the API from the Mix package. This change was made to make it easier to identify the utilities provided by Mix. For example, to access the `box` namespace, you should use `$box`.

| Before 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 |
| ------- | ------ |
| `box`   | `$box` |
| `text`  | `$text` |
| `icon`  | `$icon` |
| `image`  | `$image` |
| `flex`  | `$flex` |
| `stack` | `$stack` |

#### The new Namespaces `$on` and `$with`

Two new namespaces were added to the Mix package: `$on` and `$with`. The `$on` namespace is used to access ContextVariants, such as `$on.hover`, `$on.focus`, and `$on.press`. Meanwhile, the `$with` namespace is used to access all the modifiers provided by Mix. 

```dart
PressableBox(
  onPress: () {},
  style: Style(
    $box.width(200),
    $box.height(200),
    $box.color.blue(),

    $with.scale(2), // <-- Modifier
    $with.opacity(0.5),
    
    $on.hover( // <-- ContextVariant
      $box.color.red(),
    ),
    $on.press(
      $box.color.green(),
    ),
  ),
  child: Box(),
)

```
