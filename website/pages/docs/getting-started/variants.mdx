# Variants

## Overview

While building your design system you will find have the need to create certain variations of a Widget. This makes the design system more flexible and reusable, by leveraging shared visual properties between them.

In the following example `hover()` is a `Variant` that will be applied when `Pressable` triggers the hover state.

```dart highlight="8-11"
final style = Mix(
  width(750),
  height(50),
  rounded(10),
  textStyle($button),
  bgColor($primary),
  textColor($onPrimary),
  hover(
    bgColor($primary),
    textColor($onPrimary),
  ),
);

Pressable(
  mix: style,
  child: const TextMix('Button'),
);
```

Variants can be extremely powerful, and allow you to create consistent variations of your Widgets.

## Built-in Variants

Mix already has some `Reactive Variants` defined which can be used to create responsive Widgets.

### Pressable

These are `Variants` that will change based on different _gestures_ and state of the `Pressable` Widget.

- `hover()`: Applies attributes on hover.
- `focus()`: Applies attributes on focus.
- `press()`: Applies attributes when pressing.
- `disabled()`: Applies attributes when disabled.

### Breakpoints

- `large()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `large` breakpoint.
- `medium()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `medium` breakpoint.
- `small()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `small` breakpoint.

Breakpoints for these sizes can be configured in the `MixTheme`.

### Orientation

- `portrait()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in portrait orientation.
- `landscape()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in landscape orientation.

### Dark Mode

- `dark()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in dark mode.
- `light()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in light mode.

## Custom Variants

Mix gives you complete control of how to define your own `Variants` and when they are applied.

There are two types of `Variants` that you are able to define.

### Callable Variants

Can be called manually when they need to be applied. You can define a variant the following way.

```dart highlight="6-10"
const outlined = Variant('outlined');

final mix = Mix(
    bgColor(Colors.black),
    textColor(Colors.white),
    outlined(
        bgColor(Colors.transparent),
        borderColor(Colors.black),
        textColor(Colors.black),
    ),
);
```

You are then able to choose when to apply the variant based on your own logic.

```dart

Pressable(
  mix: mix.withVariant(outlined),
  onPress: () {},
  child: TextMix('Outlined Button'),
);

```

You are also able to pass the variant through MixableWidgets `variant` parameter

```dart
Pressable(
  mix: mix,
  variant: outlined,
  onPress: () {},
  child: TextMix('Outlined Button'),
);

```

### Reactive Variants

These are `Variants` that have a method that defines when they should be applied based on the `BuildContext`. These will be applied automatically.

Here is an example implementation of the `dark()` to understand how it works.

```dart
final dark = Variant(
    'dark',
    shouldApply: (BuildContext context) {
        return Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
    },
);
```
