# Variants

While building your design system you will find have the need to create certain variations 
of a Widget. This makes the design system more flexible and reusable, by leveraging shared 
visual properties between them.

In the following example `hover()` is a `Variant` that will be applied when a `Pressable` 
triggers the hover state. The `bgColor` and `textColor` properties will be overridden with the new value when the variant applies

```dart highlight="8-13"
final style = Mix(
  bgColor(MaterialTokens.colorScheme.primary),
  textColor($onPrimary),
  hover(
    bgColor(MaterialTokens.colorScheme.primary), 
    textColor($onPrimary),
  ),
);

Pressable(
  mix: style,
  child: const TextMix('Button'),
);
```

Variants can be extremely powerful, and allow you to create consistent variations of your 
Widgets.

## Usage

To use a variant, call it on a _Mix_

```dart
final mix = Mix(
  dark(
    textColor(Colors.white),
  ),
  light(
    textColor(Colors.black),
  )
);
```

### Conditional operators

The operators `|` and `&` can be used to add conditions to your mix:

- `|`: whether one of the variants apply

```dart highlight="3-7"
final mix = Mix(
  padding(20.0),
  (small | medium)( // Whether it's small OR medium
    width(300),
    height(400),
    bgColor(Colors.white),
  ),
);
```

- `&`: when all of the variants apply

```dart highlight="3-6"
final mix = Mix(
  padding(20.0),
  (hover & press)( // When it's hovering AND pressing
    textColor(Colors.black),
    bold(),
  ),
);
```

The `not` operator can also be called to execute the variant content only when the given
variant is not called. For example:

```dart highlight="2-4"
final mix = Mix(
  (not(disabled))(
    scale(1.2),
  ),
);
```

## Variants catalog

Mix already has some `Reactive Variants` defined which can be used to create responsive 
Widgets.

### Pressable

These are `Variants` that will change based on different _gestures_ and state of the 
`Pressable` Widget.

- `hover()`: Applies attributes on hover.
- `focus()`: Applies attributes on focus.
- `press()`: Applies attributes when pressing.
- `disabled()`: Applies attributes when disabled.

### Breakpoints

- `small()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `small` breakpoint.
- `medium()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `medium` breakpoint.
- `large()`: Applies attributes when the screen is at least `large` breakpoint.

Breakpoints for these sizes can be configured in the `MixTheme`:

```dart
MixTheme(
  data: MixThemeData(
    breakpoints: MixThemeBreakpoints(
      small: 600, // cellphone
      medium: 1240, // tablet
      large: 1440, // desktop
    ),
  ),
  child: ...,
),
```

### Orientation

- `portrait()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in portrait orientation.
- `landscape()`: Applies attributes when the screen is in landscape orientation.

### Dark Mode

- `dark()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in dark mode.
- `light()`: Applies attributes when the theme is in light mode.

### State Holding

- `active()`: Applies attributes when the widget state is marked as active
- `inactive()`: Applies attributes when the widget state is marked as inactive

### Text Styling

For widgets such as Dialogs, Cards and Modals, it's good to have titles and content.

- `title()`: Applies attributes when the `TextMix` is marked as title
- `paragraph()`: Applies attributes when the `TextMix` is marked as paragraph

```dart highlight="2-7"
final mix = Mix(
  title(
    titleCase(), // Makes the title uppercase
    font(
      weight: FontWeight.bold, // Makes the title bold
    ),
  ),
);
```

All other texts that are not marked as `title` will not be touched.

## Custom Variants

Mix gives you complete control of how to define your own `Variants` and when they are 
applied.

There are two types of `Variants` that you are able to define: callable and context 
variants.

### Callable Variants

Can be called manually when they need to be applied. You can define a variant the following 
way.

```dart highlight="6-10"
const outlined = Variant('outlined');

final mix = Mix(
  bgColor(Colors.black),
  textColor(Colors.white),
  outlined(
    bgColor(Colors.transparent),
    borderColor(Colors.black),
    textColor(Colors.black),
  ),
);
```

You are then able to choose when to apply the variant based on your own logic.

```dart highlight="2"
Pressable(
  mix: mix.withVariant(outlined),
  onPressed: () {},
  child: const TextMix('Outlined Button'),
);
```

You are also able to pass the variant through the `variant` parameter on the 
`MixableWidget` constructor

```dart highlight="3"
Pressable(
  mix: mix,
  variant: outlined,
  onPressed: () {},
  child: const TextMix('Outlined Button'),
);

```

### Context Variants

These are `Variants` that have a method that defines when they should be applied based on 
the `BuildContext`. These will be applied automatically.

Here is an example implementation of the `dark()` to understand how it works.

```dart highlight="3-5"
final dark = Variant(
  'dark',
  shouldApply: (BuildContext context) {
    return Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark;
  },
);
```
