# FlexBox (Flex)

This is equivalent to the **Flex** widget in Flutter. Everything you can do with the `Box` widget, you can also do with `FlexBox`. However, the main difference is that you can specify flex attributes for it.

### Usage

```dart
FlexBox(
  style: Style(
    $box.color.blue(),
    $flex.direction.horizontal(),
    $flex.mainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween(),
  ),
  children: [
    Box(
      child: Text('Box 1'),
    ),
    Box(
      child: Text('Box 2'),
    ),
    Box(
      child: Text('Box 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

### HBox

is equivalent to the `Row` widget, but it also accepts **Box** styling attributes.

```dart
HBox(
  style: Style(
    $box.color.blue(),
    $flex.mainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween(),
  ),
  children: [...],
)
```

### VBox

is equivalent to the `Column` widget, but it also accepts **Box** styling attributes.

```dart
VBox(
  style: Style(
    $box.color.blue(),
    $flex.mainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween(),
  ),
  children: [...],
)
```

## Utilities

The Flex utility provides an easy way to compose `FlexSpecAttribute`. The `$flex` variable is an instance of the `FlexSpecUtility` class, serving as an entry point for building the styling attributes for  `StyledFlex`, `StyledRow`, `StyledColumn`, `FlexBox`, `HBox`, and `VBox`.

### **direction**

Controls the axis along which the `Flex`, `Row`, or `Column` distributes space and positions its children.

```dart
// Set the direction to horizontal.
$flex.direction.horizontal();

// Set the direction to vertical.
$flex.direction.vertical();
```

### **mainAxisAlignment**

Customizes how children are aligned along the main axis.

```dart
// Align children at the start of the main axis.
$flex.mainAxisAlignment.start();

// Space children evenly across the main axis.
$flex.mainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly();
```

### **crossAxisAlignment**

Aligns children within the cross-axis of the flex container.

```dart
// Align children to the center of the cross axis.
$flex.crossAxisAlignment.center();

// Stretch children to fill the cross axis.
$flex.crossAxisAlignment.stretch();
```

### **mainAxisSize**

Defines the size of the main axis.

```dart
// Set the main axis to take only as much space as its children need.
$flex.mainAxisSize.min();

// Set the main axis to take as much space as available.
$flex.mainAxisSize.max();
```

### **verticalDirection**

Specifies the vertical ordering of children.

```dart
// Order children from top to bottom.
$flex.verticalDirection.up();

// Order children from bottom to top.
$flex.verticalDirection.down();
```

### **textDirection**

Controls the direction of text and children positioning if relevant.

```dart
// Set text and children positioning to left-to-right.
$flex.textDirection.ltr();

// Set text and children positioning to right-to-left.
$flex.textDirection.rtl();
```

### **textBaseline**

Adjusts the alignment of children relative to the text baseline.

```dart
// Align children by their alphabetic baseline.
$flex.textBaseline.alphabetic();

// Align children by their ideographic baseline.
$flex.textBaseline.ideographic();
```

### **clipBehavior**

Defines how the flex container should clip its content.

```dart
// Do not clip any overflow of children.
$flex.clipBehavior.none();

// Clip any overflow of children to the container's bounds.
$flex.clipBehavior.hardEdge();
```

### **gap**

Sets the space (gap) between each child in the flex container.

```dart
// Set a gap of 8 logical pixels between children.
$flex.gap(8);
```
