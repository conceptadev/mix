# PressableBox

A widget that builds on Flutter's interactivity foundation to provide a pressable area with customizable style and behavior.

It is designed as a flexible and style-friendly alternative to the traditional `GestureDetector` widgets.

With `PressableBox`, you can apply visual changes when user interactions like pressing or focusing occur, and integrate these seamlessly into your styled components.

## Usage

To use `PressableBox`, simply wrap your widget with it and specify the interaction callbacks you're interested in, along with any styles you wish to apply:

```dart
PressableBox(
  style: Style(
    $box.color.blue(),
      $on.press(
        $box.color.red(),
      ),
      $on.hover(
        $box.color.green(),
      ),
    ),
  onPress: () => print('Pressed!'),
  child: StyledText('Press Me'),
);
```

In the example above, the `PressableBox` will apply a blue background color to the child `StyledText` by default, and a red background color when the user presses on it (and a green background color when the user hovers over it, if the platform supports it). The `onPress` callback will also be invoked when the user presses on the `PressableBox`.

## Interaction States

`PressableBox` integrates with various context variant utilities that apply styles based on different widget states and gestures. Here are a few of the interaction states and their corresponding styling hooks:

- `$on.press`: Styles applied when the widget is being pressed.
- `$on.longPress`: Styles applied when the widget is being long-pressed.
- `$on.disabled`: Styles applied when the widget is disabled and therefore non-interactive.
- `$on.enabled`: Styles applied when the widget is enabled and interactive.
- `$on.focus`: Styles applied when the widget gains focus.
- `$on.hover`: Styles applied when a pointer has hovered over a widget.

### Interaction events

All the interaction states have corresponding callbacks that can be used to handle the interaction events, you can do this throught the method `event`. For example:

```dart
PressableBox(
  style: Style(
    $box.color.blue(),
      $on.press(
        $box.color.red(),
      ),
      $on.hover.event((e) {
        if (e!.position.x > 0) {
          return Style(
            $box.color.red(),
          );
        }
        return Style(
          $box.color.amber(),
        );
      }),
    ),
  onPress: () => print('Pressed!'),
  child: StyledText('Press Me'),
);

```

Using the `event` method in `hover`, you can access the `PointerEvent` and apply styles based on the event. The same can be done for the other interaction states as well. The only difference is that the parameter of the `every` method varies depending on the interaction state.

- `$on.press.event(Style Function(bool))`: It is triggered when the widget is being pressed
- `$on.longPress.event(Style Function(bool))`: It is triggered when the widget is being long-pressed.
- `$on.disabled.event(Style Function(bool))`: It is triggered when the widget change its state to disabled.
- `$on.enabled.event(Style Function(bool))`: It is triggered when the widget change its state to enabled.
- `$on.focus.event(Style Function(bool))`: It is triggered when the widget gains focus or loses focus.
- `$on.hover.event(Style Function(PointerPosition?))`: It is triggered when the mouse pointer is over the widget.
